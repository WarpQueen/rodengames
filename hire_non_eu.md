# Recruiting a non EU citizen

When hiring a person from outside of the EU, there are a lot of things that have to be exactly right, or they will get kicked out. Which is bad for both me and them. With that in mind, here is a guide if I ever need to do that again, to make it easier the next time.

This is the information from [Migrationsverket](https://www.migrationsverket.se/arbetsgivare/du-vill-anstalla/anstalla-fran-lander-utanfor-eu-ees/anstallning/anstalld.html#svid10_2cd2e409193b84c506a2a791).

Here we can read that the demands are:

1. You need to post a job ad at Migrationsverket.  
2. You'll need to have a contract of employment. Hopefully you were planning on this anyway.  
3. Terms of employment and salary.  
4. They need proper insurance. This is **a thing**, so let's get back to that.  
5. You must let the union make a statement.

## Job ad at ArbetsfÃ¶rmedlingen

You make an account as an employer at [ArbetsfÃ¶rmedlingen](https://arbetsformedlingen.se/for-arbetsgivare/rekrytera/annonsera-i-platsbanken), then you can create a job ad.  
**Remember the timeline:** it needs to be up for ten days before you can sign a contract with anyone.

## Contract

The contract needs to contain:

- Employee name and address  
- Employer name and address  
- Information about the location of the worksite (office address)  
- Title and short description of job assignment  
- Form of hire (tillsvidare-, visstids- eller provanstÃ¤llning)  
- Starting date *(Tip: have the starting date be "when the work permit is approved". Otherwise, if the approval process takes too long and the starting date is passed, you may need to apply again)*  
- Notice period, the length of the probationary period, or the end date of employment  
- Salary and other benefits, and how often salary is paid  
- Work hours  
- Overtime rules and compensation  
- Vacation days or vacation compensation  
- What collective agreement applies, if any

## Terms of employment and salary

They need to uphold certain standards. What those are will differ per year â€” they update the exact salary one must have, for example.  
Check [Migrationsverketâ€™s page](https://www.migrationsverket.se/arbetsgivare/du-vill-anstalla/anstalla-fran-lander-utanfor-eu-ees/anstallning/anstalld.html#svid10_2cd2e409193b84c506a2b60b).

## Insurance

The information at [Migrationsverket](https://www.migrationsverket.se/arbetsgivare/du-vill-anstalla/anstalla-fran-lander-utanfor-eu-ees/anstallning/anstalld.html#svid12_2cd2e409193b84c506a3109b) is rather vague, but this is crucial. This was honestly one of the scariest parts.  

After digging around, I got info from a kind man at Max Matthiessen. I wasnâ€™t interested in moving my whole company over to them for everything, so I couldnâ€™t get the insurances via him. Eventually I figured out the requirements:  

- Pension: 4.5% of salary up to 7.5 income base amounts. 30% on salary above that.  
- Health insurance: 80% protection of gross salary (ITP1-sjuk).  
- Premium exemption: Protects so that the insurance company pays the pension premium after 90 days of sick leave.  
- TGL (Life insurance): 6 income base amounts.  
- TFA (Workplace accident insurance): Bought via [Fora](https://www.fora.se/).  

In practice: this was a huge pain to arrange. A lot of insurance companies donâ€™t even offer this. Eventually, I found a salesperson at [LÃ¤nsfÃ¶rsÃ¤kringar](https://www.lansforsakringar.se/stockholm/foretag/) who helped me find the right setup.  

It sounds simple, but honestly this was the part that took the longest â€” just finding a company that was interested at all.

## The Union

This part was interesting. On Migrationsverketâ€™s homepage, it says that I need to let the union (any I choose) make a statement to say if the contract equals a collective agreement or not.  

I asked two unions, and they both declined to reply, because we did not have a collective agreement. (Which, by the way, is *not* a requirement.) So I thought everything had stalled here.  

Then I got in contact with HR at Mojang, who explained that while the union has to make a statement, I donâ€™t actually need their approval. *eyeroll*  

So I just proceeded with my application anyway. After about a week (maybe two), it got approved.

## After

Success! All done? Alas, no. Within three months after the approval, you'll need to tell Skatteverket what is happening via this form:[Skatteverket](https://www.skatteverket.se/foretag/etjansterochblanketter/blanketterbroschyrer/blanketter/info/1160.4.64a656d113f4c759701233.html)
It should then be sent to:

Skatteverket
205 30 MalmÃ¶

(I was unable to find an e-mail, so enjoy my annoyed handwriting Skatteverket!)

Puh! So, the next time, I can just replicate exactly what I did here, and the whole process will be **much faster**.  
And since youâ€™re reading this, so can you. Enjoy the fruits of my labor ðŸŽ‰
