# Recruiting a non EU citizen

When hiring a person from outside of the EU, there are a lot of things that has to be exactly right, or they will get kicked out. Which is bad for both me and them. With that in mind, here is a guide if I ever need to do that again, to make it easier the next time.

This is the information from <a href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/arbetsgivare/du-vill-anstalla/anstalla-fran-lander-utanfor-eu-ees/anstallning/anstalld.html#svid10_2cd2e409193b84c506a2a791">Migrationsverket</a>.

Here we can read that the demands are: 
1. You need to post a job ad at Migrationsverket. 
1. You'll need to have a contract of employment. Hopefully you were planning on this anyway.
1. Terms of employments and salary.
1. They need proper insurnance. This is A THING, so let's get back to that. 
1. You must let the union make a statement.

I'll go through each of these. 

**Job ad at Arbetsförmedlingen**

You make an account as an employer at <a href="https://arbetsformedlingen.se/for-arbetsgivare/rekrytera/annonsera-i-platsbanken">Abetsförmedlingen</a>, then you can create a job ad.
Now remember the timeline. It needs to be up for ten days before you can sign a contract with anyone.

**Contract**

The contract needs to contain: 
* Employee name and address.
* Employer name and address.
* Information about the location of the worksite (office address).
* Title and short description of job assignment.
* Form of hire (tillsvidare-, visstids- eller provanställning).
* Starting date (Tip: have the starting date be "when the work permit is approved". Otherwise if the approval process is too long and the starting date is passed, you may need to apply again).
* Notice period, the length of the probationary period, or the end date of employment.
* Salary and other benefits,and how often salary is paid.
* Work hours.
* Overtime rules and compensation.
* Vacation days or vacation compensation.
* What collective agreement applies if any.

**Terms of employments and salary**

 They need to uphold certain standards. What those are will differ per year, they update the exact salary one must have for example, so check <a href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/arbetsgivare/du-vill-anstalla/anstalla-fran-lander-utanfor-eu-ees/anstallning/anstalld.html#svid10_2cd2e409193b84c506a2b60b"> the link</a>.

**Insurance**

The information at <a href="https://www.migrationsverket.se/arbetsgivare/du-vill-anstalla/anstalla-fran-lander-utanfor-eu-ees/anstallning/anstalld.html#svid12_2cd2e409193b84c506a3109b"> Migrationsverket</a> is rather fluffy here, but also, this is crucial, so this was a scary part. 
I dug around, and I got this info from a kind man at Max Matthiessen. I was not really interested in going over to them for the whole company though, so I could not get the insurances via him.

* Pension 4.5% av lön upp till 7.5 Inkomstbasbelopp. 30% på lönedelar över.
* Sjukförsäkring, 80% som skydd av bruttolön. (ITP1-sjuk)
* Premiebefrielse: Skyddar så att försäkringsbolaget betalar pensionspremien efter 90 dagars sjukskrivning.
* TGL (Livförsäkring) 6 prisbasbelopp.
* TFA – Olycksfall på arbetsplatsen, Tecknas via Fora (fora.se)

So I had to dig around for this, and ask a lot of people. A lot of insurance companies do not offer this at all. In my innocence I though I'd just have to call up my regular insurer and say "Hey, I need the standard migrationsverket insurances for hiring from abroad". 
That was not the case at all. TFA can almost exclusively be be bought at <a href="https://www.fora.se/"> FORA</a>. Then eventually, I found a salesperson at <a href="https://www.lansforsakringar.se/stockholm/foretag/"> Länsförsäkringar</a> who helped me find the right things and got me signed up with them. 
It sounds simple, but this was the part that took the longest actually. Just trying to find a company that was interested at all.

**The Union**

This part was interesting. On Migrationsverkets homepage, it says that I need to let the Union (any I choose) make a statement to say if the contract equals a collective agreement or not. I asked two Unions, and they both declined to reply, because we did not have a collective agreement...
Which is not a requirement, btw. So I thought everything had stalled here. Then I got in contact with HR at Mojang, who explained to me that while the Union has to make a statement, I don't actually have to get approved by them! *eyeroll*
I could just proceed with my application anyway. So I did,  and then it took like a week (maybe two), and it got approved.

Puh! So, the next time, I can just replicate exactly what I did here, and this whole process will be SO MUCH FASTER! And since you are reading this, so could you. Enjoy the fruits of my labor.
